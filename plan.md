# Structured Ingestion Plan

## Objective

Build a new structured ingestion path that takes a directory of repos, code files, and articles and turns them into dataset drafts automatically.

This path must:

- stay separate from the existing raw chunk collector
- preserve provenance and file relationships
- parse C and C++ repositories first
- keep related source and header files together
- understand Visual Studio project structure without requiring a build
- extract code snippets from `html`, `htm`, and `mhtml` with surrounding context
- prepare bounded source bundles for LLM drafting so context is preserved without overloading prompts

## Confirmed Decisions

- Default flow: `directory -> parsed artifacts -> dataset drafts` automatically
- Optional parser dependencies are allowed
- V1 source scope: `c`, `cc`, `cpp`, `cxx`, `h`, `hh`, `hpp`, `hxx`, `inl`, `asm`, `s`, `inc`, `asmx`, `html`, `htm`, `mhtml`, `md`, `txt`, and code/text files already handled by the repo
- Deferred for later: `pdf`, `docx`, binary document formats, and compilation/build execution

## Status Legend

- `completed`
- `in_progress`
- `pending`
- `blocked`

## Current Status Summary

- Branch setup: `completed`
- Planning document: `completed`
- Structured ingestion implementation: `completed`
- Tree-sitter parser upgrade: `completed`

## Proposed Architecture

Add a new structured ingestion path rather than extending `scripts/collect.py`.

Planned new components:

- `scripts/ingest.py`
  - top-level entry point for structured source ingestion
- `scripts/utils/discovery.py`
  - path walking, project detection, source classification, manifest creation
- `scripts/utils/artifacts.py`
  - artifact writing and loading helpers
- `scripts/utils/parsers/base.py`
  - parser interface and shared helpers
- `scripts/utils/parsers/c_family.py`
  - C/C++ parsing, include graph extraction, header/source pairing
- `scripts/utils/parsers/html.py`
  - `html` / `htm` / `mhtml` article parsing and snippet extraction
- `resources/internal-schema/source_artifact_schema.json`
  - schema for parsed source artifacts and relation records
- `workspace/ingest_runs/<run_id>/`
  - run-local parsed artifacts, manifests, bundles, and reports

## Planned Workspace Outputs

Each structured ingestion run should write:

- `manifest.json`
- `files.jsonl`
- `units.jsonl`
- `relations.jsonl`
- `bundles.jsonl`
- `ingest_report.json`

Definitions:

- `files.jsonl`: one record per source file with path, type, hash, project membership, and provenance
- `units.jsonl`: extracted symbols, snippets, sections, and chunkable semantic units
- `relations.jsonl`: links such as `includes`, `declares`, `implements`, `companion_of`, `belongs_to_project`, and `snippet_from`
- `bundles.jsonl`: bounded context packages used to draft dataset records

## V1 Parsing Rules

### C/C++

- group source and header companions by basename and include graph
- capture `#include` relationships
- extract top-level symbols where possible
- record unresolved includes instead of silently discarding them
- prefer deterministic parsing first, then use the LLM only on bounded bundles

### Visual Studio

- parse project and solution membership from `.sln` and `.vcxproj` files
- use `.vcxproj.filters` to preserve logical structure when present
- do not require Windows, MSBuild, or compilation for V1

### HTML / HTM / MHTML

- strip non-content boilerplate where possible
- extract each code block as a separate unit
- capture section heading, surrounding paragraphs, source path, and inferred language
- treat `mhtml` as an article source with embedded page content when decodable

## Non-Goals for V1

- compiling or executing source projects
- PDF or DOCX parsing
- binary reverse-engineering
- full semantic cross-repo call graph construction
- language support beyond the approved C/C++ and article-focused first pass

## Post-Plan Upgrade

- `SI-13` was added after the initial plan to improve parser fidelity for native code repositories.
- The ingest path now prefers tree-sitter for `c`, `cpp`, and `asm` symbol extraction and records the parser backend in artifact metadata.
- Heuristic parsing remains available as the deterministic fallback path when the optional dependency is unavailable.

## Commit Plan

Each implementation step should be committed separately with a detailed message describing:

- what changed
- which tasks moved status
- which files were added or modified
- what was tested

Initial commit for this document:

- adds `plan.md`
- records the approved structured ingestion architecture
- defines task IDs and statuses for the implementation sequence
