# Dataset-Generator-Skill Task Tracker

## Build Contract

- Status: `in_progress`
- Goal: Build an agentic dataset generation skill for Codex, Antigravity, and Claude Code that supports SFT and DPO workflows, tool-guided data collection, resumable SQLite state, verification, deduplication, export, and data-card generation.
- Source documents:
  - `Plan/plan.md`
  - `docs/media/dataset-skill-architecture.svg`
  - `docs/media/industry-pipeline.svg`

## Confirmed Decisions

- Status: `completed`
- Support both SFT and DPO automatically based on the user's request.
- Prefer `target-schemas/` naming for export schemas and keep the structure internally consistent.
- Generate the data card automatically as an artifact of export instead of as a separate top-level command.
- Support both JSONL and CSV inputs/outputs in v1.
- This is a tool-native skill for Codex, Antigravity, and Claude Code, not a direct LLM-provider API pipeline.
- The agent should use built-in IDE capabilities and user-provided material for search, browsing, reading, and reasoning, while local scripts handle deterministic transforms.
- Support three primary user entry paths:
  - User asks the LLM to generate a dataset from a topic or task description.
  - User provides URLs or reference data to be structured into a dataset.
  - User provides existing datasets from various sources to be normalized, verified, deduplicated, and exported.
  - User asks the agent to search the internet and compile a dataset from discovered material using the IDE's own browsing/search tools.

## Task List

| T06 | Shared runtime utilities | Add reusable utilities for prompt loading, schema helpers, CSV/JSONL parsing, structured record conversion, and local run-state management. | `completed` |
| T07 | Generation pipeline | Implement `scripts/generate.py` for turning agent-collected or user-provided material into canonical dataset records and tracked run state. | `completed` |
| T08 | Augmentation pipeline | Implement `scripts/augment.py` for diversity transformations such as tone shifts, persona changes, difficulty changes, and adversarial variations. | `completed` |
| T09 | Verification pipeline | Implement `scripts/verify.py` with heuristic refusal detection, schema validation, and structured review support for LLM-as-judge steps done inside the IDE. | `completed` |
| T10 | Deduplication pipeline | Implement `scripts/dedup.py` with exact and near-duplicate detection using MinHash/LSH. | `completed` |
| T11 | Export pipeline | Implement `scripts/export.py` for OpenAI/Hugging Face style JSONL and CSV exports, dataset splits, and automatic data-card output. | `completed` |
| T12 | Input ingestion | Support URL/reference-data workflows, existing dataset ingestion workflows, and tool-collected web research workflows that normalize material into the canonical schema. | `completed` |
| T13 | Sub-skill prompts | Create the markdown prompt files in `sub-skills/` for strategy, seeding, diversity, filtering, judging, deduplication guidance, export formatting, data card generation, and verification-only flows. | `completed` |
| T14 | Skill orchestrator | Create `SKILL.md` as the orchestration entry point for `dataset generate`, `dataset verify`, and `dataset export`, including resume detection and route selection by user intent across the three IDEs. | `completed` |
| T15 | Verification and QA | Run local smoke checks, validate the schema and scripts, and document any limits tied to local tool availability rather than provider integrations. | `completed` |
| T16 | Automated tests | Add unit and integration-style tests for canonical normalization, DB-backed pipeline flows, and export schema behavior. | `completed` |
| T17 | CI workflow | Add a GitHub Actions workflow that installs dependencies and runs compile/test checks on pushes and pull requests. | `completed` |
| T18 | Export schema validation | Validate custom flat export schemas strictly before export runs and fail with actionable errors. | `completed` |
| T19 | Richer export reporting | Expand export summaries and generated data cards with column lists, distributions, artifact lists, and run metadata. | `completed` |
| T20 | Skill behavior tightening | Tighten the orchestration contract in `SKILL.md` and sub-skills so each route maps clearly to the deterministic script layer. | `completed` |
| T21 | GitHub documentation | Add GitHub-facing repository documentation for installation, architecture, workflows, and current gaps. | `completed` |
| T22 | Diagram alignment | Update architecture/media SVGs so command names, script roles, schema directories, and pipeline wording match the current repo setup. | `completed` |
| T23 | Judge prompt hardening | Tighten `sub-skills/llm-judge.md` so review outputs are strictly raw JSONL with no conversational filler that would break `verify.py`. | `completed` |
| T24 | Default sizing and prompt examples | Default generation requests to 500 records unless the user specifies another size, and add richer natural-language prompt examples for users. | `completed` |
| T25 | Schema-validation CI fix | Validate only canonical schema fields under `jsonschema` so DB/runtime metadata does not cause CI-only record rejection, and add a regression test for the strict-validator path. | `completed` |
| T26 | Packaging metadata | Add `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, and align CI/dependency installation with the declared runtime dependencies. | `completed` |
| T27 | Governance docs | Add `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` so usage, disclosure, and contribution paths are explicit. | `completed` |
| T28 | Install hardening | Fix the repo URL in `install.sh`, add checksum-based remote-install guidance, and publish `install.sh.sha256`. | `completed` |
| T29 | Untrusted-ingestion guardrails | Strip hostile control characters during normalization, flag likely prompt-injection markers on untrusted sources, and surface review flags in metadata and skill docs. | `completed` |
| T30 | README polish | Add a CI badge, GitHub metadata guidance, safer install guidance, 500-record rationale, security notes, and a roadmap section. | `completed` |
| T31 | Lean install payload and tag packaging | Restrict `install.sh` to the runtime skill payload only, and on tag pushes build and publish packaged runtime artifacts in GitHub Actions. | `completed` |

## Open Technical Notes

- Status: `in_progress`
- The canonical schema needs to support both single-response and preference-pair records without forcing separate pipelines.
- Tool-native reasoning will live in `SKILL.md` and sub-skills, while Python scripts stay deterministic and operate on already-collected material or local files.
- URL ingestion and internet-assisted collection will be designed into the architecture, but any live network-dependent paths may need to remain unexecuted in this sandboxed environment.
