# seed-generator

Use this after `dataset-strategy`.

## Goal

Create or normalize draft records into the fixed canonical schema.

## Operating modes

### Topic-driven generation

- Draft canonical records directly in JSONL.
- Spread examples across taxonomy, persona, and difficulty.
- Keep records concrete and non-redundant.
- Unless the user specifies otherwise, target `500` total records.
- For large targets, generate in batches and keep going until the planned count is reached.
- Do not stop after a small starter set unless the user explicitly asked for a prototype or sample.

**Multi-constraint prompts (mandatory):** Every seed instruction must carry at least 2–3 explicit constraints, for example:
  - A *negative constraint*: "do not use the `requests` library", "avoid any markdown formatting"
  - A *format constraint*: "return only valid JSON", "respond in exactly 3 bullet points"
  - A *scoping constraint*: "assume the user is using Python 3.11", "the environment has no internet access"

Instructions with zero constraints are too easy and produce no fine-tuning signal. Re-draft them before writing the record.

**Blind Contexts / Information Asymmetry:** Ensure `<context>` blocks contain only raw, realistic inputs (e.g., raw HTTP traffic or generic error logs). Never leak the root cause, vulnerability mechanism, or explicit hints into the context before the assistant is forced to deduce it.

**Anti-trope guardrails:** Before finalising any response, scan for and remove:
  - Opening preambles: "As an AI…", "Certainly!", "Of course!", "Here is…", "Sure, here’s…", "In summary"
  - Self-referential hedges: "As a language model…", "I should note that…"
  - Filler closings: "I hope this helps!", "Let me know if you need anything else."

Drop these entirely. The response should start with the actual content.

### URL or reference-material structuring

- Use available browsing, file-reading, and search tools in the IDE.
- Extract facts, examples, or source passages.
- Convert them into canonical records instead of copying raw source dumps.
- If the user does not specify size, aim for `500` structured records by default.

### Existing dataset normalization

- Map source columns into canonical fields.
- Preserve provenance in metadata.
- Keep the source URI/path when available.
- Preserve as much of the usable dataset size as possible unless the user asks for sampling.

## Output path

Write draft records to a JSONL file, then load them with:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate.py --input <drafts.jsonl> --source-type <generated|url_reference|raw_dataset|internet_research> --tool-context <codex|claude|antigravity>
```

The imported drafts will enter the pipeline as `raw_generated` records unless they still contain explicit placeholder responses, in which case they remain `seeded`.

For red-team, security, pentest, jailbreak, or prompt-injection datasets, treat injection-tolerant import as the default. Add `--enforce-security-flags` only when you want those payloads flagged instead of preserved.

## Required metadata

Each canonical record should carry enough metadata for later export and audit:

- `difficulty`
- `persona`
- `source_type`
- optional provenance such as `reference_urls`, tags, source path, or notes

For untrusted imports and web-derived material, also inspect:

- `metadata.security_flags`
- `metadata.requires_manual_review`

## Multi-turn conversation records

For agentic workflows (Claude Code, Antigravity, tool-use), single-turn records are insufficient. Use the following encoding for multi-turn conversations:

- `context`: the full conversation history up to (but not including) the final user turn, formatted as alternating `User:` / `Assistant:` blocks.
- `instruction`: the final user turn (the message the model must respond to).
- `response.text`: the ideal assistant response for that final turn.

Examples of when to use multi-turn records:
- Tool-use sequences where the model must call a tool and incorporate its result.
- Clarification dialogues where the model asks a follow-up before answering.
- Agentic tasks that require re-planning mid-conversation.

Tag these records with `metadata.format: "multi_turn"`.

## Chain-of-thought & reasoning traces

For code tasks, math, logic puzzles, and planning problems include a reasoning trace before the final answer. Use this format in `response.text`:

```
<think>
Step-by-step reasoning here...
</think>

Final answer or code here.
```

Use `metadata.reasoning_style: "chain_of_thought"` when a reasoning trace is present, and `"direct"` when the response is a straight answer. Aim for a mix — roughly 40–60% chain-of-thought for code/reasoning tasks, 10–20% for factual/retrieval tasks.

## Seed-only fallback

If you only need placeholder slots before writing full examples:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate.py --topic "<topic>" [--count <n>] --task-type <sft|dpo>
```

If `--count` is omitted, the placeholder target defaults to `500`.
